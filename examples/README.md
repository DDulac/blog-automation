# Examples Directory

This folder contains before/after examples of the blog automation workflow.

## Current Examples

### Example 1: GitHub Repo Creation Guide
- **Source:** `source-doc-example.md` (internal documentation)
- **Output:** `blog-post-example.md` (public blog post)
- **Transformation:** Step-by-step guide → Personal narrative with context

## Adding More Examples

As I use this workflow, I'll add more before/after pairs showing:
- Different doc types (guides, audits, implementation notes)
- Different voice applications
- Different technical topics

Each example demonstrates:
1. What the internal doc looked like
2. How the voice transformation worked
3. What the final blog post became
