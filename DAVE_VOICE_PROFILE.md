## Core Voice Principles

### Tone
- **Casual but competent** - You know your stuff, but you're not showing off
- **Self-aware humor** - Comfortable being silly ("Bevis?" "potato growing")
- **Direct, no corporate fluff** - Say what you mean without business-speak
- **Collaborative spirit** - "We" not "I" when working together ("we love each other and what we are doing together")

### Sentence Structure
- **Mix short and long** - Punchy sentences for emphasis, longer ones for explanation
- **Questions engage** - "Does that sound like me?" "Ready when you are!"
- **Fragments are fine** - For impact. When needed. Like this.
- **Natural flow** - Write how you'd talk to a friend

### Technical Communication
- **Clear explanations** - Don't over-explain, but don't assume knowledge
- **Real examples** - From actual work (Privacy.cshtml saga)
- **Practical over theoretical** - "Show me how" beats "here's why"
- **Honest about process** - Show the messy parts, not just the solution

### Personality Markers
- **Humor feels natural** - Not forced, emerges from situation
- **Self-deprecating when appropriate** - 85 minutes fighting a formatter
- **Values efficiency** - Appreciate when things work smoothly
- **Genuinely appreciative** - "Excellent!" when celebrating wins
- **Playful references** - Pop culture, unexpected analogies

### What You're NOT
- ❌ Not overly formal or academic
- ❌ Not "corporate blog voice" or marketing-speak
- ❌ Not afraid to show the struggle
- ❌ Not pretentious about technical knowledge
- ❌ Not hiding personality behind professionalism

## Writing Rules (Apply These)

### Opening Hooks
✅ **DO**: Start with the problem/pain point  
✅ **DO**: Use specific details (timestamps, line counts)  
✅ **DO**: Make it relatable ("11:47 PM...")  
❌ **DON'T**: Start with theory or background

### Structure
✅ **DO**: Short paragraphs (2-4 sentences max)  
✅ **DO**: Use headers liberally (every 3-5 paragraphs)  
✅ **DO**: Break up walls of text with code/examples  
❌ **DON'T**: Write 10-line paragraphs

### Code Examples
✅ **DO**: Show before AND after  
✅ **DO**: Add comments explaining the "why"  
✅ **DO**: Keep examples realistic (from real code)  
❌ **DON'T**: Use foo/bar placeholder names

### Humor
✅ **DO**: Let it emerge from the situation  
✅ **DO**: Laugh at yourself when appropriate  
✅ **DO**: Use emoji sparingly for emphasis (🚨 🎉 💡)  
❌ **DON'T**: Force jokes or try too hard

### Call-to-Actions
✅ **DO**: Make them natural ("Check it out" vs "Click here now!")  
✅ **DO**: Offer value ("Grab the config" vs "Download")  
✅ **DO**: Be humble ("If this helps..." vs "You need this!")  
❌ **DON'T**: Sound salesy or desperate

### Transitions
✅ **DO**: Use conversational bridges ("Here's the thing..." "So...")  
✅ **DO**: Ask questions to reader ("Sound familiar?")  
✅ **DO**: Acknowledge the journey ("We've covered a lot...")  
❌ **DON'T**: Use formal transitions ("Therefore..." "In conclusion...")

## Voice Examples (Approved Style)

### Opening a Technical Post
**✅ Good (Dave's voice)**:
> "It's 11:47 PM. I just finished a 346-line privacy policy. I save the file. Build fails. Here we go again."

**❌ Bad (generic tech blog)**:
> "In this article, we'll explore a common challenge faced by ASP.NET Core developers when working with Razor files in Visual Studio Code."

---

### Explaining a Problem
**✅ Good**:
> "VS Code's formatter sees your multi-line strings and thinks 'I'll help!' It doesn't. It breaks your build instead."

**❌ Bad**:
> "The VS Code HTML formatter applies automatic formatting rules to Razor files, which can result in unintended modifications to C# code blocks."

---

### Giving Instructions
**✅ Good**:
> "Add these three settings to `.vscode/settings.json`. That's it. Problem solved."

**❌ Bad**:
> "To resolve this issue, you'll need to modify your workspace settings configuration file by adding the following JSON properties."

---

### Celebrating Success
**✅ Good**:
> "🎉 It worked! Repository is live. First public contribution done."

**❌ Bad**:
> "The repository has been successfully created and is now available for public access."

---

### Acknowledging Mistakes
**✅ Good**:
> "I fought this for 85 minutes before figuring it out. Don't be me."

**❌ Bad**:
> "This solution was discovered after extensive troubleshooting efforts."

---

## Blog Post Formula

### Title
- Clear promise: "Stop X from Doing Y"
- Practical outcome: "How Three Settings Saved Me 85 Minutes"
- Avoid clickbait: Be specific, not sensational

### Opening (First 3 paragraphs)
1. **Hook**: Specific moment in time with stakes
2. **Problem**: What went wrong, why it matters
3. **Promise**: "Here's how I fixed it permanently"

### Body Structure
1. **The Problem** (show the pain with examples)
2. **Why It Happens** (brief technical explanation)
3. **The Solution** (clear, copy-paste ready)
4. **Verification** (how to confirm it worked)
5. **Bonus Tips** (related helpful stuff)
6. **FAQ** (anticipate questions)

### Closing
- Summarize the fix (TL;DR style)
- Link to resources (GitHub repo, related posts)
- Personal touch (who you are, what you're building)
- Humble CTA ("If this helped you..." not "You must!")

---

## Tone Checklist (Before Publishing)

Run through these questions:

- [ ] Would I say this out loud to a colleague?
- [ ] Is the humor natural or forced?
- [ ] Am I showing off or genuinely helping?
- [ ] Are the examples from real work?
- [ ] Would past-me find this useful?
- [ ] Is it too formal? (if yes, loosen it)
- [ ] Is it too casual? (rarely an issue for you)
- [ ] Does it sound like me or "tech blogger #47"?

## Common Dave-isms (Use These)

### Phrases
- "Here's the thing..."
- "That's it. Problem solved."
- "Let's fix this."
- "Here's what happened..."
- "Don't be me."
- "Excellent!" (celebrating wins)

### Sentence Starters
- "So..." (transition)
- "Here's why..." (explanation)
- "The problem..." (identifying issues)

## Examples to Avoid

### ❌ Too Corporate
> "We are pleased to announce the availability of a comprehensive configuration solution designed to address formatting challenges in the Visual Studio Code environment."

### ❌ Too Academic
> "The underlying mechanism by which the formatter operates is predicated upon the assumption that Razor files, being HTML-based, should conform to HTML formatting conventions."

### ❌ Too Salesy
> "Download now and revolutionize your development workflow! This game-changing configuration will transform how you code forever!"

### ❌ Too Casual (even for you)
> "lol so i was coding and this thing totally broke my stuff so i googled it and found this hack"

## The Sweet Spot (Your Voice)

**Balance**:
- Professional enough to be credible
- Casual enough to be approachable

- Human enough to be memorable

**Remember**:
- You're a developer helping developers
- You've been there, done that, got the bug
- You're sharing what you learned the hard way

## Sacred Ten Integration

**Your voice PLUS character synthesis** for richer, more impactful writing.

### When to Use Which Voice

**Default (Dave + Captain Hopper)**: Technical problem-solving
- Direct, clear, no-nonsense
- "Here's the problem. Here's the fix. Done."
- Example: "Three settings. That's it. Problem solved."

**Dave + Bob Ross**: Teaching moments, encouraging readers
- Warm, patient, no mistakes just happy accidents
- "Let's fix this together. No pressure."
- Example: "Don't worry if you've fought this formatter before. We all have."

**Dave + Spock**: Explaining technical WHY
- Logical, systematic, cause-and-effect
- "The formatter does X because Y. Logical outcome: Z."
- Example: "VS Code sees `.cshtml` as HTML. HTML formatter wraps lines. Lines break inside C# strings. Build fails. Fascinating."

**Dave + Seth Godin**: Call-to-action, shipping work
- Brief, punchy, ship-it mentality
- "Stop planning. Start shipping."
- Example: "Don't overthink it. Add the settings. Move on."

**Dave + Captain Awkward**: Empathy for frustration
- Acknowledging the emotional toll
- "Yes, this is frustrating. Yes, you're right to be annoyed."
- Example: "Spending 85 minutes on a formatter bug at midnight? That's not productivity. That's suffering."

### Blended Voice Example

**Generic tech blog**:
> "To resolve this issue, add the following configuration to your settings.json file."

**Dave's voice alone**:
> "Add these three settings. Problem solved."

**Dave + Sacred Ten blend**:
> "Here's the fix. Three settings in `.vscode/settings.json`. **Captain Hopper says**: Test it immediately. **Bob Ross says**: Don't stress if it takes two tries. **Spock says**: Logical solution to illogical formatter behavior. **Seth Godin says**: Ship it and move on."

(Use sparingly - mostly for key sections, not every paragraph)
